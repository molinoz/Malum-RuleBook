Each Creature is formed from a number of different stats and abilities, the most important being:

Attributes

- Strength (STR): Physical power in lifting, swinging, and running.
    
- Agility (AGI): Physical deftness and grace in aiming, climbing, and dodging.
    
- Constitution (CON): Physical fortitude in health, perseverance, and immune system.
    
- Intelligence (INT): Mental power in problem solving, analytical thinking, and cognizance.
    
- Wisdom (WIS): Mental deftness in experience, comprehension, and attention to detail.
    
- Willpower (WIL): Mental fortitude in mind, confidence, and personality.
    

Every "Attribute" has associated [skills](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/skills) and effects on your characters capabilities. There are a few types of skill checks that you may need to make. These are attribute checks, skill checks, and attribute(skill) checks. Attribute checks only add your attribute bonus to the roll, skill checks add the bonus of a skill and the attribute attached to it, and attribute(skill) checks allow you to choose between the skill or the attached attribute.

All checks have a DC, and all checks have 4 degrees of success:

- Critical Success-Beat DC by 10 or more.
    
- Success-Meet or beat the DC.
    
- Failure-Fell below the DC
    
- Critical Failure-Fell 10 or more below the DC
    

[Skills](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/skills)

Skill are in two categories, Combat Skills and None-Combat Skills. Combat Skills are a +0 when untrained and are a minimum of 5 on skill checks when trained, while None-Combat skills are at a -5 when untrained and have a minimum of 5 on skill checks when trained. [Skills](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/skills) also have levels, each level in a trained [skill](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/skills) increases the bonus to skill checks with that [skill](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/skills) by 1.

Many points over a session of gameplay, the WOF or an ability will call for a "Check". These checks are a d20 dice roll, adding any modifiers to the roll after it is rolled, and reading aloud the total of that "Check". A check will might have a specified "DC" standing for Difficulty Class and is the number your total must either be equal too or exceed in order to succeed. Beating a DC by 10 or more is considered a Critical Success, and may have additional effects, while falling 10 or below the DC is a Critical Failure.

Checks generally come in the following forms, although there are other check types, those are specified later in this section.

- ATTRIBUTE check: This check calls for you to roll a 1d20 and add your bonus from the associated attribute (A DC 15 Strength check requires you roll a 1d20 and add your Strength bonus).
    
- ATTRIBUTE(SKILL) check: This check calls for you to roll a 1d20 and add your bonus from the associated attribute or the associated skill, as skills you are untrained with give you a penalty, it might be beneficial to not use that skill in the situation (A DC 15 Strength(Athletics) check requires you roll a 1d20 and add your Strength bonus or your Strength bonus and Athletics skill bonus, you may choose).
    
    - Some checks may ask for an Attribute and skill combination that are misaligned (asking the player to make a Willpower(Immunity) check for example) in these situations you use either the attribute bonus or the skill bonus with the current attribute (A DC 15 Willpower(Immunity) check requires you roll a 1d20 and add your Willpower bonus or your Willpower bonus and Immunity skill bonus, you may choose).
        
- SKILL check: This check calls for you to roll a 1d20 and add your bonus from the associated skill (A DC 15 Athletics check requires you roll a 1d20 and add your Strength bonus and Athletics skill bonus, even if your Athletics skill is negative).
    

Combat

Each creature in combat has an initiative (Calculated as "[Nimble](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/skills)" + "[Awareness](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/skills)") and at the start of combat, turn order is organized by highest to lowest initiative. Creatures that share initiative and are allies decide between themselves who goes first, otherwise players go first (In cases of PVP, have players roll a 1d20 to determine) and players may also freely exchange their initiative at the start of the round as long as a player below initiative from an enemy does not go above that enemies initiative. Sometimes a group may get the jump on the other, for these situations refer to [Ambush and Surprise.](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/stealth-and-light/ambush-and-surprise)

Each player has 3 "[Actions](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/actions)", each consisting of two half-actions, that can be spent on there turn to perform what they choose from a list. In addition, players have 1 reaction, allowing them once per round to spend one of there action, or two half-actions, outside of there own turn. Reactions are able to be performed by a trigger, either another creature finishing an action, or at any point of a creatures "Move" action. Finally, players have defensive-actions, these special reactions have no limit, allowing you to spend a half action to perform from a list of choices, but are exclusively triggered when taking damage from a source (Such as a stream of bullets hitting you, or the blast of a grenade).

Using your "[Action](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/actions)" economy, you can move, attack, and react throughout a combat encounter.

When an attack is made, the attacker makes an attack roll, factoring in any and all advantages/disadvantages and negatives or positives to there attack roll. The attack roll is then compared to the targets total Defence, if the attack meets or exceeds the Defence, it is a hit. The chart below labels the outcomes in full.

- Critical Success-You hit the target and deal double damage.
    
- Success-You hit the target.
    
- Failure-You do not hit the target.
    
- Critical Failure-You do not hit the target and there might be additional penalties depending on circumstance.
    

Some creatures will have another "Stat", Absorption either from armor or certain abilities. Absorption is layered over a creatures Defence and if the attack roll would fall inside in range, the damage is halved after DR.

When an attack hits and damage is rolled, but before DR and Absorption are calculated, the hit creature can perform a Defensive action to try and defend itself. All base Defensive actions are half actions.

- Block: Choose a limb, weapon, or shield to block with. Make a AGI([Dexterity](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/skills)) + melee weapon skill check against the targets attack roll. If you meet the attack roll or exceed it, you subtract 1 + STR Bonus damage as DR from that attack before it hits you. Most melee weapons and shields provide bonuses for the roll and DR.
    
- Dodge: Make an AGI([Nimble](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/skills)) check against the targets attack roll. For every point you meet or beat the attack roll by, you add 1 to your Defence for the purpose of that attack. You add your cover defensive bonus to this roll.
    
- Parry: Contest Your [Dexterity](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/skills) + Weapon Skill vs the attackers AGI([Dexterity](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/skills)) + Weapon skill. If you would beat both the opponents roll and the attack roll, the attack misses and the attacker is considered Vulnerable to you (they disadvantage on the next defensive action made against you, and you have advantage on the next attack roll made against them).
    

Whenever an attack is made, the attacker chooses a limb, with Core being the default with no effect if chosen. Most creatures will have Core, Arm, Leg, and Head as selectable options. Different options will have different penalties and HP, with the following as examples found on most creatures and characters. Limb HP is equal to a creatures proc limit.

- Core: No effect.
    
- Arm: -5 on attack roll to hit this Limb. If reduced to 0 HP the creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls, defensive actions, and skill checks made with this arm, cannot use this arm for somatic components or holding an item.
    
- Leg: -5 on attack roll to hit this Limb. If reduced to 0 HP the creatures Defence is decreased by 4, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, defensive actions, and skill checks made with this Leg, and moves at half speed. If both legs are injured creature is forced to become prone,
    
- Head: -10 on attack roll to hit this Limb. If reduced to 0 HP all damage dealt to the head is doubled.
    

Creatures will have to make Moral checks as combat continues, making Standard Moral Checks at the following intervals.

- At half health.
    
- At 0 or less health.
    
- When an ally goes below 0 HP.
    

When a creature has positive Moral, that creature can once per round add their positive Moral to a roll after the roll has been made. This bonus can also be split up on multiple different rolls.

When a creature has negative Moral, all rolls have that subtracted as a penalty.

Death and Knocked Out

When a creature is at 0 or less HP, that creature must succeed a Mortality check (DC 5 + health below 0 Endurance check), on success the creature stays conscious, on failure the creature is knocked unconscious until that creature has more than 0 HP. 

For example a creature at 0 hp would not need to make this check, but if that creature took 5 damage, they would be at -5 hp and need to make a Mortality check (DC 5 + health below 0 in this case would be DC 10).The creature must make this check at the start of each of its turns until it has more than 0 HP. Once a creature is unconscious it can no longer make the check.

A creature only dies when its negative HP equals its max HP.

A WOF is free to decide that certain (Often Generic) creatures are "mobs" and therfore die upon reaching 0, while more important creatures named "NPC's" follow these rules. A WOF should inform the players if a creature is a mob or NPC, and if they will be following these rules.

AOE Checks

Some attacks and effects have the AOE tag, covering an area defined by the shape of the AOE and its size.

Whenever an AOE attack is made, creatures attempting to escape harm makes an AOE Check. This is a Agility(Nimble) check + any deflection and absorption that creature has against the DC. On success the attacks damage is treated as if it was an absorbed hit.

AOE effects have a shape, being either a Cone, Line, Circle, or Ring.

- Cone: Cones are X ft. wide at base, X ft. long, and X ft. wide at the end. Most Cones are only 5 ft. wide at base, and begin adjacent to its source.
    
    - This is written as "Effect creates a 5 ft. by 30 ft. cone"
        
- Line: Lines are X ft. wide and X ft. long. Most Line are only 5 ft. wide, and begin adjacent to its source.
    
    - This is written as "Effect creates a 5 ft. by 30 ft. line"
        
- Circle: Circles have a radius of X ft. and begin at the center of its source.
    
    - This is written as "Effect creates a 30 ft. Circle"
        
- Ring: Circles have a radius of X ft. at its core where the effect doesn't cover and a radius of X ft. around that core. Most rings have a core radius of 5 ft. and begin at the center of its source.
    
    - This is written as "Effect creates a 30 ft. Ring with a 5 ft. Core"
        

Standard Moral Check

Many abilities will call for a "Standard Moral Check" which is the standard check made for when a creature might falter in battle. This check is a DC 15 Willpower(Moral) check with the following effects:

- Critical Success-Gain 1 Moral up to 0.
    
- Success-No effect.
    
- Failure-Lose 1 Moral.
    
- Critical Failure-Lose 2 Moral.
    

Wounds and Injury

When a creature takes damage in combat, half of the damage (rounded down) is considered "Wounds", and cannot be healed during combat, acting as a new max hp. Your "Max HP" is the maximum HP you can have from your class and other stats, while your max hp during combat factoring in wounds and other debuffs is your "Field HP". 

After combat finishes all creatures enter "Reprieve". This is a small moment where the creatures can reload, heal, and recover any abilities used in combat. Creatures automatically heal all lost HP, however they do not recover wounds.4

During reprieve, half the amount of wounds you have, rounded down, become "Deep Wounds" while the remaining become "Light Wounds". During reprieve creatures may use different methods to heal light wounds, including Medical skill checks, items, and spells. Any light wounds that remain at the end of reprieve become deep wounds.

When a limb is injured, it is healed when a number of wounds equal to its health are recovered, or you are fully healed.

Whenever a creature takes damage equal to half its max HP, that creature chooses a limb to be injured, and makes a DC 15 Endurance check, becoming Vulnerable and Shocked on failure.

Misery and Health

Many things done in the overworld and combat will effect your abilities. These are measured as two stats, Health and Misery. Health is associated with both Endurance and Immunity skills, while Misery is associated with Moral. Negative Health will impose levels of [exhaustion](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/tags-and-keywords/conditions) on players, while Misery imposes negative Moral on players. Weather, Long Rests, Eating and Drinking, and disease can all penalize these stats.

Rations

Rations are separated into 3 types, general rations, ingredients, and luxury foods. General rations have no effects, and one is enough to satisfy a players number of needed rations per day. Ingredients are not optimal to eat on there own, two ingredients satisfy 1 rations worth of food, but force the player to make a DC 15 Willpower(Moral) check or gain a level of misery. Luxury foods allows a player consuming them to make a DC 15 Willpower(Moral) check and have no penalty on failure, while also satisfying a daily ration need.

Activities

Activities represent what your characters do over the coarse of 24 hours. At the start of each day, each character has 6 activities, acting as a form of daily action economy, and each activity is representative of 4 hours. It is assumed that the first activities performed each day will be a long rest (2 activities) and followed by a eating a drinking (1 Activity) leaving the players each 3 remaining activities over the coarse of the day. Below is a list of all generic activities.

- Long Rest: 2 Activities
    
    - Players must complete a long rest once per day and can only complete this activity once per day, or else for each day they do not they gain a level of exhaustion. Long rests also allow players to heal deep wounds, healing a number equal to the number of HPI's that player has and their Constitution bonus.
        
- Eating and Drinking: 1 Activity
    
    - Players must complete this activity once per day or make a DC 15 Willpower(Moral) check or gain a level of misery and a DC 15 Constitution(Endurance) check or lose a level of health. It is assumed that while the activity is a single 4 hour chunk, your characters are eating a drinking throughout the day, and this is simply a representation of the combined time. Players consume their daily need of rations and as long as drinking water is available in the area, players are assumed to have gathered and purified that water.
        
- Rest and Relaxation: 1 Activity
    
    - Players performing this activity heals wounds similar to long resting, healing a number equal to half what a long rest would heal. Players can also make a DC 15 Willpower(Moral) check to recover a point of misery.
        
- Travel: 1 Activity
    
    - Players can travel a number of miles equal to the slowest move speed in the group, every 5 ft. of move speed equaling (X i aint calculated this shit yet) per activity.
        
- Explore: 1 Activity
    
    - Players enter a location and begin exploring that location, this is where combat, RP, and other gameplay occurs. The WOF is responsible for determining how many activities have been spent over the coarse of exploring.
        

Fate Die

The Fate Die is a once per session reroll of any skill check a player desires, inheriting any modifiers and advantages of the original roll. Tarot cards can grant additional uses for the die, and the WOF can grant additional Fate Dice under situations where the character performs actions that fit within that creatures fate, or the opposite, where they deny fate and change it.
