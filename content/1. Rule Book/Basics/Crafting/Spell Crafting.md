Spells have 3 main components: Location, Forms, Function, and Modifiers. Locations are how the spell targets, like a projectile, a touch spell, or a glyph. Forms are the spells effect when reaching a target, like an AOE or single targeting or making a Glygh. Functions are the spells effect, like damage, shielding, etc. Modifiers can be tied to other components to change them or augment them.
