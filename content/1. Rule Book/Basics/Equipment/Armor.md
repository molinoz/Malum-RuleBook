Armor represents worn equipment (And to a degree shields) which provides protection and other benefits. Armor comes in three categories, Light, Medium, and Heavy. Light armor is low weight, with either bonuses in certain skills to minimal penalties, but usually provides very little protection and so the creature must rely on outside factors to protect themselves (namely Defensive Actions). Heavy armor is the other extreme, high weight and usually extreme penalties to skills, stats, and movement in exchange for powerful defensive stats that allows a creature to trade its active defence's for passive defence. Finally medium armor represents a middle ground between the two extremes.

Armor is divided into individual pieces in individual slots, similar to weapons in hands. Armor has the Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, and Gloves. Each slot can hold 1 piece of armor for that slot unless otherwise specified (some items can be worn over others, like cloaks over the Chestplate when the cloak specifies). Armor can only be donned and doffed outside of combat. When you finish selecting what armor you wish to wear that you have, you create a "Set" and add the statistics of each piece to a pool, this pool is the stats you gain from the armor. Certain stats from this pool will be effected by your strength bonus, as noted below, and it is after each piece has been added to the pool that you subtract your Strength bonus. 

Below is a list of each stat an armor piece has and what it does, in addition to how Strength modifies that stat after the "Set" is compiled. 

- Deflection: Bonus to your Defence.
    
- Absorption: Range from which damage is reduced by half and DR takes effects.
    
- Toughness: Range inside Absorption that DR is doubled.
    
- DR: Number of damage that is reduced from incoming damage.
    
- Proc Resist: Increases the amount of damage required to cause a damage Proc.
    
- Damage Resist: When wearing two pieces that share a Damage Resist, you are considered resistant to that damage.
    
- Defence Bonus Limitations: This is subtracted to your agility Defence bonus to a minimum of + 0. (Subtract your Strength Bonus from this penalty)
    
- Agility Penalty: This is subtracted from your agility bonus. (Subtract your Strength Bonus from this penalty)
    
- Skill Penalty: This is subtracted from whichever skill bonus described. (Subtract your Strength Bonus from this penalty)
    
- Speed Penalty: This is subtracted from your movement speed. (Subtract three times your Strength Bonus from this penalty)
    
- Strength Requirement: This is the minimum Strength you must have to wear this "Set".
    
- Durability: When your armor durability is lowered below 3, subtract 1 from the Deflection, Absorption, Toughness, DR equal to the amount you have lost. When your durability is lowered to 0 the armor no longer functions. ????????????????????????????????????? 
    
- Weight: The armors weight.
    

Shields are equipment held in a hand, providing a + 10 to block checks and a + 5 to the block checks DR.
