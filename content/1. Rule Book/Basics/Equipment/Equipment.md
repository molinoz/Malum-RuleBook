Equipment is the gear you wear and fight with, including armor and weapons. All gear falls into one of the following quality levels.
- Poor
- Low
- Standard
- High
- Masterwork
- Artifact
Each quality level represents gear of better stats and durability without the aid of magic.

Durability is a stat that all gear shares. When a weapon rolls a 1, it loses a point of durability. A roll of 20 against you costs your armor durability 1. For every point below 3 durability a piece of gear is, it gains a cumulative penalty described in each section. When 0 durability is reached, the equipment is broken and can no longer be used, requiring repair which usually causes its repaired version to be 1 quality level lower.

Weapon Quality levels have the following results
- Poor: -2 to attack and damage rolls, 1/1 Durability
- Low: -1 to attack and damage rolls, 2/2 Durability
- Standard: Normally listed attack and damage roll, 3/3 Durability
- High +1 to attack and damage rolls, 4/4 Durability
- Masterwork: +2 to attack and damage rolls, 5/5 Durability
- Artifact: +3 to attack and damage rolls, 6/6 Durability
