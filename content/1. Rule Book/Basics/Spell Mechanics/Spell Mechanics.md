Spell Mechanics

Spells are a mechanic in Malum that can be used to create a large number of effects and combat utilities. Spells have an action economy, Skill, resource cost, components requirements, Focus economy, Tags, and finally the effect.

Attributes have several effects on Magic. Intelligence determines the attack rolls for spell attacks and the DC for spells aswell, while also being the associated Attribute for both Arcana and Spellcasting, and the amount of spells you know. Wisdom determines maximum mana pool, mana regeneration speed, Mana Burn healing speed, and number of spell slots. Willpower determines the ability to maintain Focus on Focus spells.

Magic has two associated skills, Arcana and Spellcasting. Arcana is used in most utility and support spells, while Spellcasting is used in most attack and defence spells.

Spells themselves have two resources to cast them.

- Mana based magic has a regenerating pool of mana points that are spent to cast spells. The max size of your mana pool is determined by your Wisdom bonus + 10 and is increased by class levels and Perks. At the start of your turn you regenerate an amount of mana equal to 5 + double your Wisdom bonus and is increased by class levels and Perks. When casting a spell and going below 0 mana, you begin to Mana Burn, every point below 0 inflicts you with 1 Deep Wound and 1 Burnt Mana, lowering your mana pools maximum by 1. Mana Burn is healed during a Long Rest, healing an amount equal to 5 + your Wisdom Bonus per Long Rest.
    
- Spell Slot based magic has a list of daily use "Slots" that are leveled, spending a slot to cast an associated level spell. Spell slots only regenerate after a Long Rest. You gain additional Spell Slots equal to your Wisdom Bonus, for every +1 you have in Wisdom, you gain a spell slot. A + 1 gives an additional 1st Level spell Slot, while a + 2 could be used either for a 2nd level spell slot or two 1st level spell slots. You cannot gain a spell slot for a level you have not already gotten from either player levels or Perks.
    

Focus

Certain spells require Focus, maintenance, or both. Maintenance is an effect where spells continue to have an effect until they are dismissed as a free action. Some spells that have maintenance will require Focus, you must spend a free action at the start of your turn to keep maintaining the spell, and when you receive damage, you must succeed a DC 5 + damage taken Willpower check, failure resulting in the loss of focus.

Burnt Mana and Mana Burn

Many effects throughout the game will "Burn Mana"Â 

Tags

Almost everything in Malum have associated tags attached to them, whether to indicate material or creature type. The players usually have two tags, "Creature" and "Human", while certain players may be androids instead, having the tags "Creature" "Machine" "Metal" "Android" while mutants have "Creature" "Mutant" tags. Tags exist as a method of identifying certain qualities of various creatures and objects so that certain effects can universally apply to them. For example certain abilities will target creatures with the "Undead" tag, or magnetics spells targeting the "Metal" tag. All spells in the game have an assortment of Tags, all spells have the "Spell" and most have the "Magic" Tags, where certain effects may counter the "Spell" tag like counterspell but not the "Magic" tag, as the "Magic" tag applies to anything with magic association, like potions or demons themselves. Various Tags interact with other tags in certain ways, usually in both defensive and offensive ways, for example the "Fire" tag is applied to the spell Fire Barrier, while the spell Jet Stream has the "Water" tag, as Jet Stream is a damaging spell coming into contact with a defensive spell, the "Water" tag is considered offensive and the relation between the "Fire" and "Water" tags is that "Fire" is vulnerable to any damage dealt by "Water" spells. Tags will also be used by certain spells that target preexisting materials, like Move Earth targets the "Dirt" and "Stone" tags for what it can move around the battlefield.
