When a creature is made difficult to see either do to darkness, fog, or cover, they are considered "Obscured". Obscurement comes in two levels.

- Lightly Obscured: Creatures that are Lightly Obscured are slightly difficult to clearly make out on first glance. Creatures gain a + 1 to their defence and to their dodge and stealth checks.
    
- Moderately Obscured: Creatures that are Moderately Obscured are difficult to clearly make out but are still visible. Creatures gain a + 3 to their defence and to their dodge and stealth checks.
    
- Heavily Obscured: Creatures that are Heavily Obscured are very difficult to make out and are barely visible. Creatures gain a + 5 to their defence and to their dodge and stealth checks.
    

When a creature is behind an object or another creature from the direction of an attack, that creature can gains cover. Cover comes in the following levels.

- 1/4 Cover: This cover only covers a small amount of the target, up to their knees or equivalent. Creatures in 1/4 cover are considered Lightly Obscured.
    
- 1/2 Cover: This covers around half of the target, coming up to their stomach or equivalent. Creatures in 1/2 cover are considered Moderately Obscured.
    
- 3/4 Cover: This covers all but a quarter of the target, coming up to their neck or equivalent. Creatures in 3/4 cover are considered Heavily Obscured.
    
- Full Cover: This entirely covers the target, preventing the target from being targeted by the attack in the first place, and the target cannot be seen (unless specified by the WOF, if the full cover would be made from a transparent material or the attacker can see through walls).
    

Cover can be invalidated depending on [Line of Sight](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/stealth-and-light) and by creatures being within 5 ft. of the object being used as cover.
