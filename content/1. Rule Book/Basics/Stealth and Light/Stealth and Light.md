Line of Sight

A creatures line of sight is their ability to target and locate a creature, including their vision, hearing, and any other senses. If a creature cannot see a creature, they are considered Blinded against that creature, and if they cannot hear a creature, they are considered Deafened against that creature. Creatures must have line of sight on a target in order to attack, use on sight abilities, and make sight based Awareness checks. A creature may still hear creatures outside its line of sight according to Sound Levels. A creatures line of sight is usually a 90 degree cone originating from their eyes in the direction of the WOF's choosing. Creatures may move their line of sight as a free action, assuming their is reason too.

For the purpose of combat, a creature can draw line of sight against another creature as long as it can either see or hear it, however a creature that cannot see a creature and is treated as Blinded will still incur disadvantage on attack rolls. If a creature is considered blinded and deafened against a creature, it cannot draw line of sight and therefore cannot target that creature.

Creatures will very often attempt to hide or sneak past obstacles, making Stealth checks to do so, however light and sound play a large part in that process.

Light Levels

Light levels determine the brightness of an area and how difficult it is to see. The following is a list of all light levels and their effects.

- Bright: A creature Looking Into (not within) a location of Bright light can see up to 1000 ft. clearly, and any creature within that line of sight which wishes to remain hidden must contest a Stealth Check against that creatures Awareness.
    
- Low-Light: A creature looking into a location of Low-Light can see up to 60 ft. away before creatures are too difficult to see and therefore don't require a stealth check. Low-Light is considered [Moderately  Obscured.](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/stealth-and-light/cover-and-obscurement)
    
- Dark: A creature looking into a location of Dark can see up to 10 ft. away before creatures are too difficult to see and therefore don't require a stealth check. Dark is considered [Heavily Obscured.](https://sites.google.com/view/malum-test/basic-rules/stealth-and-light/cover-and-obscurement)
    
- Pitch Black: A creature looking into a location of Pitch Black cannot see, creatures within don't require a stealth check. 
    

Keep in mind that visibility is determined by where the target is not the viewer, so the viewer's light level has no bearing on the check.

Sound Levels

Sound determines the distance a creature attempting to be quiet must make a stealth check compared to the listener.

- 60 ft. and beyond, creatures cannot hear another creature unless that creature is being louder than just normal traversal (talking, loud armor, or fighting can be heard further and further out. Firearms can reliably be heard up to 2500 ft. away)
    
- 15 ft - 55 ft, creatures must make a stealth check if they wish to remain unheard.
    
- If a creature moves within or is within 10 ft. that creature must make an additional stealth check.
    

Sound and Material

Different surfaces create different levels of noise when Stealth checks are made, imposing different penalties unless you are standing still.

- Grass/Carpet - 0
    
- Concrete/Hardwood - 2
    
- Tile - 4
    
- Leafy Forest Floor/Gravel/Debre - 6
    
- Metal/Dilapidated Flooring - 8
    

Stealth

When a creature is in sight of an observer and not heavily obscured, or is within 55 ft. and audible, and that creature is not trying to be stealthy (either as they do not care to be or are not aware they should be) the observer will make a DC 5 Awareness check, using the Stealth table below but in reverse.

If the creature cannot see the creature, then it makes that awareness check with only hearing, and if it can only see that creature, then it makes that check with only vision. If a creature has advantage on either checks made to see or hear another creature, or both, then that creature has advantage. However a creature must have disadvantage on all sense being used for a check to have disadvantage.

If the sneaking creature is attempting to stealth, the WOF determines if the stealth will be in action economy or not, than that creature contests the observers Awareness with there own Stealth. The following table lists the results.

- Critical Success: The creature does not know you are there and you have advantage on the next stealth check made against this creature. 45 ft.
    
- Success: The creature does not know you are there. 30 ft.
    
- Failure: The creature is alerted but not sure as too what it is that alerted them and will investigate further. 15 ft.
    
- Critical Failure: The creature knows you are there and you are a threat, will immediately alert others and act.
    

Whenever you are moving past a creature and must make a stealth check, each stealth check allows for a certain amount of movement before another check is required. If a creature would move within or is within 10 ft. of an observer that can hear it, the contest must be done again.

There are situations in which a group will attempt stealth instead of just an individual. In these situations its important to maximize the groups ability to remain out of sight and quiet, and the group should keep those who cannot regularly succeed Stealth checks fully obscured and beyond hearing range of possible observers.
